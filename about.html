                    <h2>Our Story Starts with You</h2>
                    <p>At Rensissance Faires across the country, we would experience a wide variety of communities.
                        Each community is different and we would return home to the PNW and miss what made this
                        area so special. We realized it then - what we were missing was our sense of <i>home</i>.
                        This began our journey to find what made this part of the country so inviting and how we 
                        could encompass that through the joy of the renaissance faire. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The PNW is known for being... well, quirky! Portland, where the concept for The PNW RenFaire
                         was born, is full of unique visual arts and colorful inviduals. We knew that the goofy people
                         of the PNW deserved a RenFaire that felt like home to them. We promise to bring you the quirky, 
                         accepting, and passionate warmth you known from the Portland community to our faire.  </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We are excited for you to join us! Come make our faire yours at The PNW RenFaire.</p>

                    <h3>Community</h3>
                    <p class="community-content">Community is at the heart of everything we do at The PNW 
                        RenFaire. From performers and vendors to guests and volunteers, we believe a faire 
                        is more than an event—it’s a shared experience built on connection, kindness, and 
                        belonging. We strive to create a welcoming space where everyone feels seen, celebrated, 
                        and invited to be part of the story.</p>

                    <h3>Entertaiment</h3>
                    <p class="entertainment-content">Our entertainment brings the spirit of the Renaissance 
                        to life through music, performance, and playful storytelling. From lively acts to quiet 
                        moments of wonder, each performer helps create an atmosphere of joy, imagination, and 
                        shared delight that invites guests to fully step into the magic of the faire.</p>

                    <h3>Passions</h3>
                    <p class="passions-content">Our vendors are skilled artisans, makers, and merchants who 
                        bring creativity and craftsmanship to every corner of the faire. Each booth tells a story,
                         offering thoughtfully made goods and interactive experiences that celebrate tradition, 
                         artistry, and the joy of supporting small creators.</p>

                    <p class="vendors-content">The PNW RenFaire is guided by values of inclusivity, respect, and 
                        authenticity. We are committed to creating a space where everyone feels welcome to express 
                        themselves, explore freely, and connect with others in a spirit of openness and mutual 
                        appreciation.</p>
