                <h2>Pricing</h2>
                <p>All tickets for The PNW RenFaire must be purchased in advance to ensure a smooth and 
                    welcoming experience for everyone. The faire is held rain or shine, so we encourage guests to plan 
                    accordingly and come ready to enjoy the day no matter the weather. General Admission tickets are 
                    non-refundable, while VIP ticket holders may request refunds in accordance with our refund policy. 
                    This helps us keep the event running reliably while still offering flexibility to our VIP guests.</p>
                <p>The PNW RenFaire is open Friday through Sunday from 12:00 PM to 8:00 PM, 
                    giving you plenty of time to explore the grounds, enjoy the entertainment, and visit your 
                    favorite vendors. Whether you’re stopping by for a few hours or staying for the full day, we look 
                    forward to welcoming you and helping make your visit a memorable one.</p>

                <h2>Event Schedule</h2>
                <p>Most events at The PNW RenFaire are available on a first come, first served basis, 
                    with seating opening as space allows. VIP guests enjoy access to exclusive seating areas for arena events, 
                    while all other seating is filled in the order guests arrive. If you’re hoping to sit close to the action, 
                    we recommend arriving at least fifteen minutes before the event’s scheduled start time to secure 
                    a good spot.</p>
                <p>Some events have special requirements for guests. The Tavern Expedition is limited to guests who are 21 years 
                    of age or older, and valid ID may be required. Themed Workshops each have their own participation guidelines,
                     which will be clearly posted at the corresponding shop so you can plan ahead and choose the experiences 
                     that are right for you.</p>
